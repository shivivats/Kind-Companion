# Kind-Companion
An android app focusing on mental well-being.


The app was made to help people deal with anxiety. It was developed over a course of 3 months as part of my internship for my Masters Game Studies and Engineering course.

You can find more details about the app on my website here: http://www.shivivats.io/portfolio/kind-companion
